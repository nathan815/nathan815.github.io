<b>Enemy Clouds (Dec 2017)</b> <a href="https://github.com/nathan815/EnemyClouds" target="_blank">github repo</a> or <a href="https://expo.io/@nathan815/enemyclouds" target="_blank">try it on expo</a>
A Flappy Bird-like game that I made for my COSC 231 "Internet-based Computing" class. It was my first React Native app. The project was originally to make an app with MIT App Inventor but we were given the choice to use another system or framework, so I decided to learn React Native and build my app with it. It was an interesting experience and is what sparked my interest in React Native.

            <div id="project-fishnet">
<b>FishNet (Oct 2017)</b> <a href="https://devpost.com/software/fishnet-0v8hez" target="_blank">view devpost submission</a>
An Android app that helps make your fishing life easier and lazier. It works with a Bluetooth fishing "bobber" to alert you when a fish has been caught. It also lets you share a picture/info about it within the app as well as plotting the catch location on the map of fish catches.

            <div id="project-ecospan">
<b>EcoSPAN (Jan 2018)</b> <a href="https://devpost.com/software/ecospan" target="_blank">view devpost submission</a>
An iOS app built with Swift to help people in a crisis communicate. It uses mesh networking to connect phones from one to another and enables communication without an internet connection.

            <div id="project-swan-station">
<b>The Swan Station (2014-Present)</b> see <a href="https://theswanstation.net" target="_blank">website</a> or <a href="">trello for v2.0</a>
A web-based game simulation of "The Hatch" from LOST, where players must enter the numbers every 108 minutes to stop the electromagnetic radiation from building up and destroying the island/world.

Originally built with procedural PHP and jQuery, I'm currently working on rebuilding it from scratch with VueJS + Vuex, Laravel, Redis, and Socket.io/NodeJS. This project is teaching me quite a bit about software design patterns and modern component-based development. Best of all, it's a ton of fun and my userbase is excited for the release of v2.0!

                <b>Learning A-Z Offline Books</b> <a href="#" target="_blank">view project presentations</a> <br>This was my main project during my Learning A-Z Summer 2018 Internship. This is a feature I added to the Kids A-Z Android App that allows students to choose a book to save for offline reading at a later time (this would later be able to be expanded to multiple books). It's not yet released but may be in a future release.
